    <!-- ABOUT TEXT -->
    <section class="about-text">
      <p>
        My name is Suchit Raj, a senior Information Technology student at the University of
        Massachusetts Boston. Originally from India, I moved to the United States at the age
        of 15 and completed my education across Vermont, New York, and Colorado before
        continuing my academic journey in Boston.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am deeply interested in technology-driven problem solving, particularly in areas
        involving data analytics, visualization, and cloud platforms. I enjoy working with
        real-world data and transforming it into insights through clean design and
        structured logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I consider myself a fast learner and a collaborative team player who actively seeks
        challenges that help strengthen both technical and analytical skills.
